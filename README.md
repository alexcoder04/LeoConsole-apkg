# LeoConsole-apkg

An advanced packaging tool (apt lol) for
[LeoConsole](https://github.com/BoettcherDasOriginal/LeoConsole). It adds some
extensions on top of the default package manager that are quite handy for
developers.

For more info, check out `apkg help`.

## Installation

apkg is available in the default plugin manager. Inside LeoConsole, type

```
pkg update
pkg get apkg
reboot
```

### Bleeding-edge

You can also try out the latest unpublished version (directly from the git repo),
if you have apkg already installed (keep in mind, it could be unstable):

```
apkg get https://github.com/alexcoder04/LeoConsole-apkg.git
reboot
```

## Naming

The name consists of multiple ideas merged together:

 - LeoConsole's `pkg`
 - Debian's `apt`
 - Alpine's `apk`

In total it makes `apkg` xD. Have fun with it!
